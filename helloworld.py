#A variable name cannot start with a number
#A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
#Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

#Data types
"""
Built-in Data Types
In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	NoneType

g = -87.7e10  #Scientific Notation
print(g)
print(f)

print(type(l))
print(type(k))
print(type(f))
print(type(g))



#Type conversion
#You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods

int1 = 1
float1 = 2.8
complex1 = 1j

#convert to float from int
conF = float(int1)
print(conF)
print(type(conF))

#convert int from float
conInt = int(float1)

#convert complex from int
conComplex = complex(int1)
print(conComplex)
print(type(conComplex))



#random numbers using random library
print(random.randrange(1, 100))


#type casting
"""
There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.

Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:

int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)
float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)
str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals

example

Integer
x = int(1)   # x will be 1
y = int(2.8) # y will be 2
z = int("3") # z will be 3

Floats
x = float(1)     # x will be 1.0
y = float(2.8)   # y will be 2.8
z = float("3")   # z will be 3.0
w = float("4.2") # w will be 4.2

String
x = str("s1") # x will be 's1'
y = str(2)    # y will be '2'
z = str(3.0)  # z will be '3.0'

"""

#slicing strings

"""
Slicing
You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.

Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.
"""
#txt[a:b]   - a = start of index    b = end of index
print(txt[3:24])    #slice from 3 to 24
print(txt[:24])     #slice from 0 to 24
print(txt[11:])     #slice from 11 to end
print(txt[-10:-3])     #Slice from backwards/opposite of forward slicing

#modifying strings
#Lower case
print(txt.lower())
#upper case
print(txt.upper())
#remove white spaces
print(txt.strip())  #gets rid of white spaces in front and behind of the string
#replace string
print(txt.replace("c" , "z"))
#split string
print(txt.split(","))


#Format string
"""
But we can combine strings and numbers by using the format() method!

The format() method takes the passed arguments, formats them, and places them in the string where the placeholders {} are

Example
Use the format() method to insert numbers into strings:
age = 36
txt = "My name is John, and I am {}"
print(txt.format(age))
"""

age = 23
height = 5.8
info = "My name is awais and I am {} years old and i am {} feet tall"
print(info.format(age, height))

"""
You can use index numbers {0} to be sure the arguments are placed in the correct placeholders:

Example
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want to pay {2} dollars for {0} pieces of item {1}."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))

"""

#escape characters
"""
Escape Character
To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.

An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.

An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

You will get an error if you use double quotes inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:
txt = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north."

To fix this problem, use the escape character \":
txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."

escapeTXT = "This is meant to be a \"escape\" clause"

#Booleans
"""
Boolean Values
In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.

You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.

When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:

Example
print(10 > 9)
print(10 == 9)
print(10 < 9)
"""

v1 = 200
v2 = 33
v3 = "Hello"
v4 = 15

if v2 > v1:
      print("v2 is greater than v1")
else:
      print("v2 is not greater than v2")

#evaluating using bool()
"""
Most values are evaluated as True if it has some sort of content

Any string is True, except empty strings.

Any number is True, except 0.

Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.
"""

print(bool("Hello"))
print(bool(15))

#evaluating using varibales
print(bool(v3))
print(bool(v4))

"""
Some Values are False
In fact, there are not many values that evaluate to False, except empty values, such as (), [], {}, "", the number 0, and the value None. And of course the value False evaluates to False.
bool(False)
bool(None)
bool(0)
bool("")
bool(())
bool([])
bool({})
"""
print(bool(False))
print(bool(None))
print(bool(0))
print(bool(""))
print(bool(()))
print(bool([]))
print(bool({}))
print(bool(''))

"""
One more value, or object in this case, evaluates to False, and that is if you have an object that is made from a class with a __len__ function that returns 0 or False:

Example
class myclass():
  def __len__(self):
    return 0

myobj = myclass()
print(bool(myobj))

#Operators
"""
Python Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
Example
print(10 + 5)

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operatorsA


Operator Precedence
Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed.

Example
Parentheses has the highest precedence, meaning that expressions inside parentheses must be evaluated first:

print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))

Example
Multiplication * has higher precedence than addition +, and therefor multiplications are evaluated before additions:

print(100 + 5 * 3)

Example
Addition + and subtraction - has the same precedence, and therefor we evaluate the expression from left to right:

print(5 + 4 - 7 + 3)

"""
print("Multiplication is highr presedence than addition")
print(100 + 5 * 3)

print("Addiditon and subtraction have the same precedence")
print(5 + 4 - 7 + 3)
