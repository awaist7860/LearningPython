#Data types
"""
Built-in Data Types
In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	NoneType

print(f)

print(type(l))
print(type(k))

#Type conversion
#You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods

#random numbers using random library
print(random.randrange(1, 100))


#type casting
"""
There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.

Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:

int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)
float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)
str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals

example

Integer
x = int(1)   # x will be 1
y = int(2.8) # y will be 2
z = int("3") # z will be 3

Floats
x = float(1)     # x will be 1.0
y = float(2.8)   # y will be 2.8
z = float("3")   # z will be 3.0
w = float("4.2") # w will be 4.2

Escape Character
To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.

Boolean Values
In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.

You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.

When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:

#Operators
"""
Python Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
Example
print(10 + 5)

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operatorsA


Operator Precedence
Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed.

Example
Parentheses has the highest precedence, meaning that expressions inside parentheses must be evaluated first:

print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))

Example
Multiplication * has higher precedence than addition +, and therefor multiplications are evaluated before additions:

print(100 + 5 * 3)

Example
Addition + and subtraction - has the same precedence, and therefor we evaluate the expression from left to right:

print(5 + 4 - 7 + 3)

#python lists
"""
List
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets:

example
Create a List:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

List Items
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

Ordered
When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

Changeable
The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

type()
From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list':

<class 'list'>

#uisng list comprehension

"""
List Comprehension
List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

Example:

Based on a list of fruits, you want a new list, containing only the fruits with the letter "a" in the name.

Without list comprehension you will have to write a for statement with a conditional test inside:

Example

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = []

for x in fruits:
  if "a" in x:
    newlist.append(x)

print(newlist)

With list comprehension you can do all that with only one line of code:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]

newlist = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]

print(newlist)


****The Syntax****

newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]

The return value is a new list, leaving the old list unchanged.

***Condition***

The condition is like a filter that only accepts the items that valuate to True.
Example
Only accept items that are not "apple":

newlist = [x for x in fruits if x != "apple"]

The condition if x != "apple"  will return True for all elements other than "apple", making the new list contain all fruits except "apple".

*The condition is optional and can be omitted:

Example
With no if statement:

newlist = [x for x in fruits]

***Iterable***
The iterable can be any iterable object, like a list, tuple, set etc.

Example
You can use the range() function to create an iterable:

newlist = [x for x in range(10)]

Same example, but with a condition:

Example
Accept only numbers lower than 5:

newlist = [x for x in range(10) if x < 5]

***Expression***
The expression is the current item in the iteration, but it is also the outcome, which you can manipulate before it ends up like a list item in the new list:

Example
Set the values in the new list to upper case:

newlist = [x.upper() for x in fruits]

You can set the outcome to whatever you like:

Example
Set all values in the new list to 'hello':

newlist = ['hello' for x in fruits]

The expression can also contain conditions, not like a filter, but as a way to manipulate the outcome:

Example
Return "orange" instead of "banana":

newlist = [x if x != "banana" else "orange" for x in fruits]

The expression in the example above says:

"Return the item if it is not banana, if it is banana return orange".

***Change Tuple Values***
Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.

But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.

Example
Convert the tuple into a list to be able to change it:

x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(x)
y[1] = "kiwi"
x = tuple(y)

print(x)

"""
Unpacking a Tuple
When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called "packing" a tuple:

Example
Packing a tuple:

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

But, in Python, we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called "unpacking":

Example
Unpacking a tuple:

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

(green, yellow, red) = fruits

print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)
"""
#Auto assigning each calue in the tuple to a varibale name

print(red)

print("new list after this")

"""
***Multiply Tuples***
If you want to multiply the content of a tuple a given number of times, you can use the * operator:

Example
Multiply the fruits tuple by 2:

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
mytuple = fruits * 2

print(mytuple)

"""
***Set***
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.

* Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.

Sets are written with curly brackets.

Example
Create a Set:

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset)

Note: Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.

***Set Items***
Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.

***Unordered***
Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.

Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.

***Unchangeable***+
Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.

Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.

***Duplicates Not Allowed***
Sets cannot have two items with the same value.

Example
Duplicate values will be ignored:

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}

print(thisset)

***Note: The values True and 1 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates:***

Example
True and 1 is considered the same value:

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", True, 1, 2}

print(thisset)

***Note: The values False and 0 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates:***

Example
False and 0 is considered the same value:

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", False, True, 0}

print(thisset)

***Get the Length of a Set***
To determine how many items a set has, use the len() function.

Example
Get the number of items in a set:

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

print(len(thisset))

"""

#getting legth with duplicates in the set
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}

print(thisset)    #shows items in set

print(len(thisset))     #this shows the items in a set, this shows 3 even though there are 4 items in thisset, but it has duplicates adn is counted as 1


"""
***Set Items - Data Types***
Set items can be of any data type:

Example
String, int and boolean data types:

set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {1, 5, 7, 9, 3}
set3 = {True, False, False}

A set can contain different data types:

Example
A set with strings, integers and boolean values:

set1 = {"abc", 34, True, 40, "male"}

***type()***
From Python's perspective, sets are defined as objects with the data type 'set':

<class 'set'>
Example
What is the data type of a set?

myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(type(myset))

***The set() Constructor***
It is also possible to use the set() constructor to make a set.

Example
Using the set() constructor to make a set:

thisset = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thisset)

"""

#Accesiing Set Items
"""
***Access Items***
You cannot access items in a set by referring to an index or a key.

But you can loop through the set items using a for loop, or ask if a specified value is present in a set, by using the in keyword.

Example
Loop through the set, and print the values:

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

for x in thisset:
  print(x)
"""

#looping through a set using a for loop

for x in thisset:
      print(x)    #loops through the items in thisset

#checing using the in command

print("apple" in thisset)     #returns true

"""
***Change Items***
Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.
"""

#Add Set Items
"""
***Add Items***
Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.

To add one item to a set use the add() method.

Example
Add an item to a set, using the add() method:

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

thisset.add("orange")

print(thisset)

"""

#adding an item to thisset
thisset.add("oranges")
print(thisset)

"""
***Add Sets***
To add items from another set into the current set, use the update() method.

Example
Add elements from tropical into thisset:

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
tropical = {"pineapple", "mango", "papaya"}

thisset.update(tropical)

print(thisset)
"""

#updating a set with another set

tropical = {"pineapple", "mango", "papaya"}

thisset.update(tropical)      #adding all items from tropical set to thisset

print(thisset)

"""
***Add Any Iterable***
The object in the update() method does not have to be a set, it can be any iterable object (tuples, lists, dictionaries etc.).

Example
Add elements of a list to at set:

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
mylist = ["kiwi", "orange"]

thisset.update(mylist)

print(thisset)
"""

thisset.update(thisList)      #adding all items from thisList(List type) to thisset
print(thisset)


#Remvoing an item
"""
emove Item
To remove an item in a set, use the remove(), or the discard() method.

Example
Remove "banana" by using the remove() method:

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

thisset.remove("banana")

print(thisset)

***Note: If the item to remove does not exist, remove() will raise an error.***

Example
Remove "banana" by using the discard() method:

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

thisset.discard("banana")

print(thisset)

***Note: If the item to remove does not exist, discard() will NOT raise an error.***

***pop()*** (Not really recommended)
You can also use the pop() method to remove an item, but this method will remove a random item, so you cannot be sure what item that gets removed.

The return value of the pop() method is the removed item.

Example
Remove a random item by using the pop() method:

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

x = thisset.pop()

print(x)

print(thisset)

***Note: Sets are unordered, so when using the pop() method, you do not know which item that gets removed.***

***clear()***
Example
The clear() method empties the set:

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

thisset.clear()

print(thisset)

***del (keyword)***
Example
The del keyword will delete the set completely:

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

del thisset

print(thisset)

"""

#loop sets
"""
***Loop Items***
You can loop through the set items by using a for loop:

Example
Loop through the set, and print the values:

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

for x in thisset:
  print(x)
"""
#looping through a set using a for loop

for x in thisset:
      print(x)    #loops through the items in thisset


#Join Sets
"""
***Join Two Sets***
There are several ways to join two or more sets in Python.

You can use the union() method that returns a new set containing all items from both sets, or the update() method that inserts all the items from one set into another:

Example
The union() method returns a new set with all items from both sets:

set1 = {"a", "b" , "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}

set3 = set1.union(set2)
print(set3)

***Note: Both union() and update() will exclude any duplicate items.***
"""

#Unions() for a new set
#update() to add another set to an already existing one

"""
***Keep ONLY the Duplicates***
The intersection_update() method will keep only the items that are present in both sets.

Example
Keep the items that exist in both set x, and set y:

x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
y = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

x.intersection_update(y)

print(x)

The intersection() method will return a new set, that only contains the items that are present in both sets.

Example
Return a set that contains the items that exist in both set x, and set y:

x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
y = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

z = x.intersection(y)

print(z)
"""

setx.intersection_update(sety)

print(setx)

#intersection()

setz = setx.intersection(sety)
print(setz)

"""
***Keep All, But NOT the Duplicates***
The symmetric_difference_update() method will keep only the elements that are NOT present in both sets.

Example
Keep the items that are not present in both sets:

x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
y = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

x.symmetric_difference_update(y)

print(x)

The symmetric_difference() method will return a new set, that contains only the elements that are NOT present in both sets.

Return a set that contains all items from both sets, except items that are present in both:

x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
y = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

z = x.symmetric_difference(y)

print(z)

***Note: The values True and 1 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates:***

Example
True and 1 is considered the same value:

x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", True}
y = {"google", 1, "apple", 2}

z = x.symmetric_difference(y)

print(z)

Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:

***Ordered or Unordered?***
As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

Unordered means that the items does not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.

***Changeable***
Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.

***Duplicates Not Allowed***
Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:

Example
Duplicate values will overwrite existing values:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
